# Project Title:
Symptoms Based Covid-19 Prediction Using Machine Learning.

## Description:

Coronavirus, also known as COVID-19, is an infectious disease that spreads from person to person. It can spread through a COVID-19 patientâ€™s cough, sneeze, or respiratory droplets. It moves from one person to another or on a substance through a carrier.
ML can help predict COVID-19 infection and estimate future COVID-19 infection counts. The  goal is to identify the best-performing machine learning model for predicting COVID-19.

## Dataset:
The data of all people who received RT-PCR nasopharyngeal swab screening for SARS-CoV-2 were made public by the Israeli Ministry of Health. I have used this dataset in the project. Here, data is collected from March 2020 - November 2021.

# Model:
I used Logistic Regression Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, and XGBoost Classifier.

# Result:
XG Boost model performed slightly better than the other two models.

# Language:
Python

# IDE:
Google Colab
